# VaR-CVaR
This mini lecture calculates Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall Monte Carlo simulations by different methodologies.
The following methods are used to calculate VaR and cVaR:
- Using the hitorical data.
- Simulating normal returns from estimated moments of the data.
- Drawing IID samples from empirical distribution of the data.
- Performing simulation from the estimated student-t distribution by MLE.
