# VaR-CVaR
This mini lecture computes Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (cVaR) Monte Carlo simulations by different methodologies.
The following methods are used to calculate VaR and cVaR:
- Hitorical data.
- Simulation from normal returns from estimated moments of the data.
- Drawing IID samples from empirical distribution of the data.
- Performing simulation from the estimated student-t distribution by MLE.
